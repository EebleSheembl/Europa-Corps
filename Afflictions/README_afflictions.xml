	! Formatting for afflictions. Follow this if adding any. 
	! Names, descriptions and anything similar must be defined in texts.
	^ Note: This style of formatting afflictions is uncommon in modding, which makes no sense because it's how afflictions are formatted in vanilla and also drastically easier to read.
